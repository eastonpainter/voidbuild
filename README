If you have any questions/problems just file an ISSUE in the ISSUES tab, the one text to the CODE tab.
The void-install.sh script should have the basic commands for setting an environment once the OS is installed. Be sure to replace `eve` with your name.
Reminder: do not run void-install.sh, it's not ready yet, so just manully type the commands in.
It will give you a basic build of `dwm` and `st`, both suckless-tools. Be sure to check https://suckless.org/ for documentation, and remember to RTFM.
Just a reminder that these are my personal dotfiles, so you don't necessarily have to use everything, be sure to know what each command does before executing it. 
I also have a large collection of aliases that may be helpful, but usually it will be best to make your own.
I also use `zsh` instead of `bash`, so be careful of that (zsh is a more modern shell than bash). 
My install will also try to set up `doas`, a much leaner alternative to `sudo` (with a much simpler .config file [permit nopass [name] as root], that's it), so consider trying that out. 
Just be sure to always replace `sudo` with `doas` when running scripts, but you can always just go back to `sudo`.
Basic utilities:
zathura: reads pdfs
vim: edit text
htop: process monitor
tty-clock: just a clock
cava: music visualizer
ncmpcpp: music [warning, a little advanced as ncmpcpp is a client that interacts with a daemon, mpd]
cmus: easier music alternative, should be in repos
zsh: modern shell
dmenu: program launcher [MOD-P by default, I believe]
firefox: browser, more secure
opendoas: doas instead of sudo
xwallpaper: set wall with `xwallpaper --zoom /path/to/file`
curl: for basic install/misc.
** Just always remember to READ THE MANUAL for most software with `man [pkg]` or `[pkg] --help`. **
And once again, these are my personal configs, so you can always edit them.

Creates a basic, usable, yet minimal config.
